How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?
Ans - Pos :-
      We systematically commit the changes in our document according to the error solved.
      Helps to create history acc. to the problem solved (Best for Coding)
      According to personal convinience.
      Cons - 
      One may forget to change after editting.
      Not good for text document , articles (anything but not codes)
      History can be precisely browsed.
    

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Ans - In git , we work with loads of Multiple files containing loads of codes upto 1000 lines so treating each file seperately 
      turns to be very slow and boring to work on such document hence working on multiple files in a commit is appreciated.
